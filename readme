 
Fortran Maximum Entropy codes (Mark Jarrell and Jim Gubernatis)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
These codes are distributed freely under a modified version of the GPL.  The only
conditions beyond the GPL on their use is that you must:

1. Report all bugs (or suspected bugs) on GitHub.
2. Return significant revisions/improvements so that they can be distributed 
   on this web page.
3. For each publication that employs this code or its derivatives, you
   must cite our review, "Bayesian Inference and the Analytic Continuation 
   of Imaginary-Time Quantum Monte Carlo Data", M. Jarrell, and J.E. 
   Gubernatis, Physics Reports Vol. 269 #3, pp133-195, (May, 1996).
4. Read this review article to see how MEM should be (and not be) used!

There are two subdirectories.  

	1. Bryan, which preforms the MaxEnt inversion of the equations
	G=KA given a vector G and a kernel K.
	
	2. Readmc, which contains the files
	
	rdbins.for reads in the binned QMC data, calculates the covariance.

	readmc_linux.for reads in the QMC data and the covariance, diagonalizes
	the covariance, generates the kernel, and rotates the kernel and the 
	QMC data into the diagonal space.
